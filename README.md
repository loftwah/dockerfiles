Dockerfiles
===========
*Light, simple and secure docker images.*

![Docker](docker.png)

My goal is to produce easy to setup, easy to maintain and secure by default dockerfiles using alpine linux.  
I try to keep them as clean and generic as possible but sometimes, they're more set for my needs (I use them after all).  

### Subcategories

#### NOT_STABLE

Directory for dockerfiles in progress or subject to big changes.  
They can break or not function at all. They have no documentation.  

#### UNMAINTAINED

Directory for dockerfiles that I don't use anymore.  
They were good enough for me before but since I don't use them, I don't update them.
